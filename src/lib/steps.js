        description: "Studied how UTX, a histone demethylase and tumor suppressor, relies on phase separation into liquid condensates for its chromatin-regulatory activity. Loss of its intrinsically disordered region (cIDR), common in cancer mutations, disrupts this process, impairing tumor suppression and chromatin interactions."

By utilizing YOLO for segmentation and LSTMs to capture the sequential nature of drugs, out method achieved impressive accuracy rates. This project has the potential to streamline the medical record-keeping process and improve patient care."
