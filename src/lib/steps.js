By utilizing YOLO for segmentation and LSTMs to capture the sequential nature of drugs, my method achieved impressive accuracy rates. This project has the potential to streamline the medical record-keeping process and improve patient care."

Loss of its intrinsically disordered region (cIDR), common in cancer mutations, disrupts this process, impairing tumor suppression and chromatin interactions."
